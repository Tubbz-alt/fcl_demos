To generate the results in the SAB paper, you will need the following steps: 

Clone https://github.com/mihahauke/vizdoom_cig2017

apt install docker.io
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
and also nvidia-docker if you wish to use your GPU for the bots in folders intelact.

Edit /etc/group and add your username to the group "docker".

./build.sh intelact
./build.sh host

Assuming this succeeded, you then run the host, followed by the bots:
./run.sh host
./run.sh intelact

Clone vizdoom from:
git clone https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom.git

Install it with:
sudo pip3 install .

To run the DFL bot:
cd dfldoom
python3 run_agentFCL.py learning_rate

Which run a deathmatch for the length of time specified in ../host/host.py, and will write to 3 files: 
KD.txt
wtDist.txt
DFLOutput.txt

The first logs a timestamp each time the bot is killed. To calculate a KD ratio, you will need to edit ../intelact/IntealAct_track2/run_agent.py to write the corresponding death events for the intel bot - or whichever one you are playing against. 
wtDist.txt logs the average Euclidean distance of the weights from their initial values, per layer.
DFLOutput.txt logs various measures: feedback error, bot steering action, health. See the code. 


If you wish to experiment further:
----------------------------------
There are a number of *.cfg files here - if you want to run deathmatch in the way described above, copy _vizdoomNetwork.cfg to _vizdoom.cfg. Assuming the host is already running, running run_agentDFL.py will then attempt to connect and start a match. It's crucial that all bots, and the host, are using the same Doom map. This is specified in their own .cfg files.  

You can use any of the .wad files that come with VizDoom, but we recommend editing them to a) have more spawn points so that the bot gets a better randomisation of starting position and increase generalisation of learning, and b) to increase the amount of ammo available, otherwise the enemy can run out of ammo and start behaving strangely. We used http://www.doombuilder.com/ for this. 

If you want to change the actions available to the bot, you need to edit config/config.cfg. At the moment, the bot only rotates in the plane, and shoots, so there is lots of scope for improvement!
